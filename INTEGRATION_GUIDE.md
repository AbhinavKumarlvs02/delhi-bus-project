# Delhi Bus Project - Frontend-Backend Integration

## üöÄ Major Improvements Made

### ‚úÖ Authentication System
- **Real Backend Integration**: Login and registration now connect to actual backend APIs
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure authentication with automatic token handling
- **Role-based Access Control**: Protected routes based on user roles (admin, driver, passenger)
- **Session Persistence**: User sessions persist across browser refreshes

### ‚úÖ Data Integration
- **Real API Calls**: All dashboards now fetch data from backend instead of dummy data
- **Dynamic Bus Management**: Bus locations, routes, and schedules come from database
- **Live Data Updates**: Refresh functionality to get latest data from server
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when backend is unavailable

### ‚úÖ UI/UX Enhancements
- **Modern Loading States**: Spinner components with loading indicators
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages with auto-dismiss
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts with Tailwind CSS
- **Role-based Sidebar**: Dynamic navigation based on user role
- **Better Error States**: Clear error messages and retry options

### ‚úÖ Technical Improvements
- **Context API**: Centralized state management for auth and notifications
- **Service Layer**: Organized API calls with caching and error handling
- **Protected Routes**: Route guards to prevent unauthorized access
- **Type Safety**: Better prop validation and error boundaries

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
# Create .env file with:
# JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here_make_it_very_long_and_secure
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/delhi-bus-project
# PORT=5000
npm start
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# From project root
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Seed Sample Data
```bash
cd server
node seedData.js
```

## üì± Sample Login Credentials

After running the seed script, you can login with:

- **Admin**: admin@delhibus.com / admin123
- **Driver**: driver@delhibus.com / driver123  
- **Passenger**: passenger@delhibus.com / passenger123

## üó∫Ô∏è Features by Role

## üîÑ API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration

### Buses
- `GET /api/buses` - Get all buses
- `POST /api/buses` - Add new bus
- `PUT /api/buses/:id` - Update bus

- `POST /api/routes` - Add new route
- `PUT /api/routes/:id` - Update route
- `DELETE /api/routes/:id` - Delete route

## üéØ Key Improvements Summary

1. **No More Dummy Data**: All components now use real backend data
2. **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based access
3. **Real-time Updates**: Live bus tracking and location updates
4. **Better UX**: Loading states, notifications, and error handling
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Service layer and context management
6. **Mobile Responsive**: Works great on all device sizes

## üöß Next Steps
